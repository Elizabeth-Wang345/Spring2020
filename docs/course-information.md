### Description

Overview and use of data science tools in Python for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, reproducible research and automated report generation. Case studies will illustrate the practical use of these tools.

Tentative outline:

* *Week 1*: Data and uncertainty
* *Week 2*: Data scraping, transformation, and wrangling
* *Week 3-4*: Visualization and exploratory analysis
* *Week 5-6*: Finance data module
* *Week 7-8*: Health data module
* *Week 9*: Text data module
* *Final Projects*: group project poster session

In past offerings of PSTAT 134/234, case studies included,

* Web data scraping and preprocessing with command line tools
* Spatial analysis of NBA shots data
* Portfolio selection using historical stock returns
* Topic modeling using Yelp review data
* Recommendation system using missing movie ratings data

### Computing Tools

Programming/scripting is a significant portion of this class. Below are my expectations.

* _Required_: Python at a level comparable to
    * [http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)
    * [http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) (including Pandas)

* _Recommended_: Unix shell at a level comparable to
    * [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

Prior knowledge of Unix shell is not critical; however, you will be asked to learn on your own as you go.
